# Go Project

This is a basic Golang web application that returns the current time.

## Project Structure

The project has a simple and modular structure:

```
app_go/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go
├── internals/
│   └── handlers/
│       ├── time.go
│       └── time_test.go
└── go.mod
```

The `cmd` directory contains the main application file, responsible for bootstrapping and starting the server.

Inside the `internals` directory, we have a `handlers` package that contains the business logic related to the time functionality and testing.

## Best Practices

Some of the best practices and improvements applied to this project include:

1. Separation of concerns: The code is arranged in a package structure that promotes a modular design and separation of different responsibilities. The handler for processing time-related requests is placed in a separate package, keeping the main logic for starting the server clean and focused.

2. Error handling and logging: The server logs errors and crucial moments, such as when the server starts. It also provides better error handling in case the server fails to start.

3. Reusability: The `TimeHandler` struct can be easily extended or reused for other projects due to its clearly defined functionality and the use of dependency injection through the `NewTimeHandler()` function.

4. Externalized configuration: The server port `(:8081)` is configurable through environment variables. This adds flexibility and easier deployment.

5. Code readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to read, which is essential for maintaining and scaling a project in the future.

6. Testing: The `handlers` package contains a test suite to validate the functionality of the `TimeHandler` struct under different scenarios and edge cases.
