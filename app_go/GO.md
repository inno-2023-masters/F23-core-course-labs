I've opted for a test-driven methodology, wherein I write tests before implementing specific functionalities in the application. I utilize Go's built-in go test functionality to execute these tests. Given that my application primarily comprises a single API endpoint displaying the current time, I've developed a unit test to verify the accuracy of the time returned by the endpoint. Additionally, I've crafted a straightforward integration test to ensure that the application is operational and returns the correct time.
Best practices:
Isolation of Unit Tests:

Unit tests are kept independent of each other. This ensures that the outcome of one test does not impact another, fostering a more robust and predictable testing environment.
Isolation from External Dependencies:

Unit tests are designed to be isolated from external dependencies. This helps in creating a controlled environment for testing, preventing issues that may arise from external factors such as network fluctuations or external service outages.
AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert):

Following the AAA pattern in unit tests enhances test readability and maintainability. This pattern emphasizes the importance of clearly separating the setup (Arrange), the action or operation being tested (Act), and the expected outcome or assertion (Assert).
Inclusion of Component and System (Integration) Tests:

Beyond unit tests, you have incorporated component and system (integration) tests. These higher-level tests focus on checking the overall behavior of the application, such as ensuring the app server is running correctly and returning the expected results.
