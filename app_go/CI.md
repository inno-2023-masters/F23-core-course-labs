# Continuous Integration (CI) Workflow for Go App

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow implemented for the Go application in this repository. The CI workflow is designed to ensure code quality, dependencies management, testing, and Docker image building.

## CI Workflow Overview

The CI workflow consists of the following main steps:

1. **Dependencies**: Download Go module dependencies to ensure a clean build environment.

2. **Linter**: Run the `go vet` command for static analysis to catch potential issues in the code.

3. **Tests**: Execute unit tests to ensure code correctness and reliability.

4. **Docker Image**: Build a Docker image of the Go application and push it to a container registry.

5. **Snyk Vulnerability Check**: Integrate Snyk for vulnerability scanning and reporting.

## Workflow Details

### Dependencies

- **Purpose**: This step ensures that all required Go module dependencies are available for building and testing the application.

### Linter

- **Purpose**: The `go vet` command is used for static analysis to detect common coding issues early in the development process.

### Tests

- **Purpose**: Unit tests are executed to validate the correctness of the code and ensure that it functions as expected.

### Docker Image

- **Purpose**: A Docker image of the Go application is built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub). This image can be deployed to various environments.

### Snyk Vulnerability Check

- **Purpose**: This step integrates Snyk to perform vulnerability scanning and identify potential security issues in the project's dependencies.

## Workflow Optimization

To optimize the CI workflow, we have implemented the following best practices:

- Environment variables and secrets are used to store sensitive information securely, such as Docker Hub credentials and Snyk tokens.

- Caching is implemented to speed up the workflow. Go modules are cached to avoid downloading them on every build.

## Workflow Status

The status of the CI workflow can be viewed on the [GitHub Actions page](../../actions) for this repository.
