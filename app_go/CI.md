Best Practices for Continuous Integration (CI)
Execute tests: Every push and merge request to the master branch triggers a testing job.

Maintain software quality: In addition to tests, include jobs for linters and vulnerability checks to ensure overall software quality.

Streamline build steps: Break down distinct units of work into reproducible steps and jobs for optimal build performance.

Enhance build efficiency with caching: Eliminate external dependencies in the project to optimize the build process through effective caching.

Safeguard pipeline security: Store sensitive information, such as Dockerhub tokens, securely by encrypting them in GitHub Secrets storage.
