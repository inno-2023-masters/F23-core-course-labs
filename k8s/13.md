## Check the content of your file in each pod, e.g., `kubectl exec pod/demo-0 -- cat visits`, and provide the output for all replicas.

╰─➤  kubectl exec moscow-time-0 -- cat /proj/data/visitors

Different pods have different persistent mounts -> independent counters

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.
Pods does not have any point of interaction such as db or other shared storages (or other kinds of interactions) in other words, it is not neccessary for them to know about each other as they are independent, thus there is no need in such guarantees.

And so we can configure them to start in parallel.
```yaml
spec:
  ...
  podManagementPolicy: Parallel
  ...
```
