# Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.

The application is designed with the sole purpose of displaying the current time, making it stateless. As a result, there is no requirement to share state among pods or enforce control over the order of execution for each pod. The total number of visits can be calculated by simply summing up the visits recorded by each individual pod.

## Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.

Can be implemented by adding the `podManagementPolicy: Parallel` to the spec section.

# Explore Update Strategies

## RollingUpdate

Gradually replaces old pods with new ones, maintaining stability and minimizing downtime.

## OnDelete

Allows manual control over pod updates by deleting them, suitable for stateful applications that require coordination during updates.

## Differences

`RollingUpdate` is an automated strategy where the controller manages the update process without manual intervention. On the other hand, `OnDelete` provides a manual approach, allowing users to trigger updates by deleting pods as needed.

`RollingUpdate` is generally suitable for applications where automated, gradual updates with minimal downtime are preferred. `OnDelete` is more suitable for stateful applications or scenarios where manual control over the update process is necessary.
