# Ordering Guarantee and Parallel Operations

## Explain why ordering guarantees are unnecessary for your app.

App is stateless, therefore no need to share state among pods and control order for each pod

## Implement a way to instruct the StatefulSet controller to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel.

Just add `podManagementPolicy` in statefulset.yaml

# Update Strategies

- **Rolling Strategy Deployment:**

  - This approach guarantees smooth updates by patiently ensuring that new pods are ready before phasing out the old ones, providing flexibility for potential issue resolution in Kubernetes deployments.

- **Recreate:**

  - While straightforward, the recreate deployment strategy incurs a brief downtime as it replaces all old pods with new ones simultaneously.

- **Blue/Green Deployments:**

  - Blue/Green deployments offer a cautious method, enabling users to engage with the old version until the new one undergoes thorough testing and approval before traffic redirection.

- **Canary Deployments:**

  - This technique offers a careful and step-by-step introduction of new functionality, initially deploying to a restricted audience before expanding to the entire infrastructure.

- **Canary Deployments with Flagger:**

  - Flagger automates the canary deployment process by dynamically adjusting traffic based on performance metrics and delivering results communication, often via platforms like Slack.

- **Dark Deployments (A/B Testing):**

  - A/B testing, or dark deployments, allows for inconspicuously introducing a new feature to a select group of users, monitoring their interactions and assessing metrics impact.

- **Flagger and A/B Deployments:**
  - Beyond canary deployments, Flagger extends its capabilities to support A/B testing scenarios, making it adaptable for controlled feature rollouts and evaluations.
