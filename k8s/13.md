# Strategies:

Explore different update strategies:

- Rolling update strategy is a popular iterative approach where each pod is updated individually, commonly used in companies like Tinkoff.
- Canary update strategy updates a small number of pods while others remain with the old version, allowing developers to check their validity before updating all other pods, making it a good strategy for large projects.
- Recreate update strategy involves deactivating all outdated pods and creating new ones for the entire system, which may not be considered safe due to potential errors in the new pods.
- Blue/green deployment strategy involves creating a separate identical environment for the new version (green) and switching traffic between versions, similar to a feature flag for release.
- Ramped Slow Rollout strategy updates by creating new replicas while removing old ones, allowing control over the pace of the rollout.
- Best-Effort Controlled Rollout is an alternative solution to Ramped Slow Rollout that prioritizes speed but involves a trade-off between speed and risk.
- Shadow deployment strategy deploys a new version of an application without affecting end-users, suitable for real-time testing of a new version.
- A/B Testing involves dividing users into groups and updating one group to a new version while the other group stays with the old version, often used to test how users perceive new features, similar to the Canary strategy.
