## Values in volumes
```bash
$ kubectl exec python-app-0 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 42}
$ kubectl exec python-app-1 -- cat /data/counter.json
{"counter": 18}
```

Each pod maintains its unique persistent storage, leading to different values. These files remain intact even when the pods are updated.
## Lack of Need for Ordering Guarantees
Pods of the same type don't depend on each other, so ordering is unnecessary. Ordering becomes relevant only when pods have distinct roles (like one pod for reading and another for writing).

## Parallel Operations Approach
The implementation of parallel operations was achieved using the `podManagementPolicy`.

## Strategies for Updating
1. **Rolling Strategy**: This default method updates replicas one at a time. It involves stopping, deleting, and recreating each pod sequentially. With multiple replicas, it ensures minimal downtime and a slight dip in performance.
2. **Recreate Strategy**: This approach updates all pods simultaneously, resulting in a complete but temporary shutdown. It's less preferred due to the downtime involved.
3. **Canary Update Strategy**: Initially, extra pods (25% more) with the new version are created. If these function well, the older pods are upgraded, and the temporary ones are removed. This strategy, more of a deployment technique rather than a built-in feature of Kubernetes, allows for bug detection with a portion of the real users.
