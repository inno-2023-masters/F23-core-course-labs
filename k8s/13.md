## StatefulSet — app_python

After changing the deployment into a stateful set, and installing the chart:

```text
$ helm install app-python app-python-0.1.0.tgz 
NAME: app-python
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 27 21:34:15 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w app-python'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default app-python --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:80
```

Let's check pods, stateful sets, services, and persistent volumes:

```text
$ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/app-python-0   1/1     Running   0          77s
pod/app-python-1   1/1     Running   0          46s
pod/app-python-2   1/1     Running   0          24s
NAME                          READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/app-python   3/3     77s
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
service/app-python   LoadBalancer   10.111.92.90   <pending>     80:30706/TCP   77s
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        14d
NAME                                     STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-python-0   Bound    pvc-01c352a2-2945-4a57-b40e-19c48af811a5   1Gi        RWO            standard       9m10s
persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-python-1   Bound    pvc-38a7ff39-e316-457a-9270-e2b1bc64eb16   1Gi        RWO            standard       46s
persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-python-2   Bound    pvc-e66462b0-0347-4001-a67b-09f927fd3351   1Gi        RWO            standard       24s
```

Next, I opened a number of incognito tabs and made a few requests. Let's check the `visits.txt` file of each pod

```text
$ kubectl exec pod/app-python-0 -- cat visits.txt
74
$ kubectl exec pod/app-python-1 -- cat visits.txt
25
$ kubectl exec pod/app-python-2 -- cat visits.txt
28
```

We can see that the number of visits differ with respect to the pods.
This happens because each of the pods has persistent volumes, that are isolated (not shared) with the others.
Hence, each pod has a private `visits.txt`, and only registers visits to itself

### Ordering guarantee

Using a StatefulSet we are dealing with a collection of independent pods: they do not share states, volumes, and provide the same service, but on their own.
Thus, ordering of the replicas creation would not affect potential users in any way — they would not even know which replica served a request.

Adding the following line to the `spec` of our StatefulSet would do the trick with parallel launching/termination
```text
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"
```

Let's try installing the chart, and check the pods

```text
$ kubectl get pods
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
app-python-0   1/1     Running   0          31s
app-python-1   1/1     Running   0          31s
app-python-2   1/1     Running   0          31s
```

Notice that pods AGE is the same for all of them — they launched in parallel

## [Bonus #1] StatefulSet — app-golang

After changing the deployment into a stateful set, and installing the chart:

```text
$ helm install app-golang app-golang-0.1.0.tgz 
NAME: app-golang
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Nov 27 22:31:22 2023
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
1. Get the application URL by running these commands:
     NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the LoadBalancer IP to be available.
           You can watch the status of by running 'kubectl get --namespace default svc -w app-golang'
  export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get svc --namespace default app-golang --template "{{ range (index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0) }}{{.}}{{ end }}")
  echo http://$SERVICE_IP:80
```

Let's check pods, stateful sets, services, and persistent volumes:

```text
$ kubectl get po,sts,svc,pvc
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/app-golang-0   1/1     Running   0          21m
pod/app-golang-1   1/1     Running   0          21m
NAME                        READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/app-golang   2/2     21m
NAME                 TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE

persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-golang-0     Bound    pvc-19532d72-87ec-4068-b787-6d4f873a3c3d   1Gi        RWO            standard       73m
persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-golang-1     Bound    pvc-1aeb317c-9d4b-4b9a-bbff-d40e01eb376e   1Gi        RWO            standard       73m
persistentvolumeclaim/www-app-golang-2     Bound    pvc-78a4bbbe-1ebd-424a-99ac-7a6a1a8fa939   1Gi        RWO            standard       73m
```

Next, I opened a number of incognito tabs and made a few requests. Let's check the `visits.txt` file of each pod

```text
$ kubectl exec pod/app-golang-0 -- cat visits.txt
56
$ kubectl exec pod/app-golang-1 -- cat visits.txt
32
```

Wan see that the number of visits differ with respect to the pods.

## [Bonus #2] Definitions

There are two update strategies

- OnDelete — disables pods' auto-update; instead, a user should delete pods manually in order to trigger the creation of the new (updated) versions of pods
- RollingUpdate — enables pods' auto-update; default update strategy: deletes and recreates each pod on update
