## Kube Prometheus Stack Components

The Kube Prometheus Stack is an ensemble of tools that work together to provide a comprehensive monitoring solution for Kubernetes clusters. Below is an explanation of its components and their roles.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is at the heart of the monitoring stack, responsible for the collection and storage of metrics data. It scrapes metrics from configured endpoints periodically and stores this data in a time-series database. It also evaluates alerting rules and triggers alerts based on these rules.

### Alertmanager

Alertmanager is tasked with handling alerts sent by Prometheus. It can group, deduplicate, and route alerts to different notification channels such as email or messaging platforms like Slack. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

### Grafana

Grafana is a visualization platform that allows you to create, explore, and share dashboards that display metrics data queried from Prometheus in a visual format. It is vital for observing the operational health of the cluster and for in-depth analysis.

### Node Exporter

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter that captures a wide variety of hardware- and OS-related metrics from the nodes of a Kubernetes cluster. It provides insights into system performance, including CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization.

### kube-state-metrics

kube-state-metrics is a service that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of the various objects in the cluster, such as deployments and nodes. This information is key to understanding how workloads are performing and how resources are being utilized.

### Prometheus Operator

The Prometheus Operator provides Kubernetes native deployment and management of Prometheus and related monitoring components. It uses Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to allow for easy configuration and automation of monitoring resources.

### ServiceMonitor

ServiceMonitor is a Custom Resource Definition introduced by the Prometheus Operator. It defines a schema for how services should be monitored by Prometheus, specifying details like endpoints, port numbers, and intervals for metrics scraping.

### Additional Components

There are several other optional components that can be included, like the Prometheus Adapter, which extends the functionality of the stack by providing a custom metrics API for autoscaling based on Prometheus metrics.

The integration of these components makes the Kube Prometheus Stack a robust and essential part of Kubernetes cluster operations, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and facilitating proactive incident management.

1. Pods (po): Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that can be created and managed in Kubernetes.
   - `pod/alertmanager-prometheus-kube...`. is a pod belonging to the Prometheus Alertmanager, which is used for alerting.
   - `pod/app-elixir-0` is a pod for an Elixir application, currently not ready.
   - `pod/app-python-0`, `pod/app-python-1`, and `pod/app-python-2` are pods for a Python application, all ready and running.
   - `pod/prometheus-grafana-...` is a pod running Grafana for dashboards, ready and running.
   - `pod/prometheus-kube-prometheus-operator-...` is a pod for the Prometheus Operator, managing Prometheus and Alertmanager deployments.
   - `pod/prometheus-prometheus-node-exporter-...`. is a pod for the Prometheus Node Exporter, which collects hardware and OS metrics.
2. StatefulSets (sts): StatefulSets manage the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods and provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.
   - statefulset.apps/alertmanager-prometheus-kube... manages the Alertmanager pod instances.
   - `statefulset.apps/app-elixir` manages Elixir app pods, currently none ready.
   - `statefulset.apps/app-python` manages Python app pods, all ready.
   - `statefulset.apps/prometheus-prometheus-kube...` manages Prometheus pods.
   - `statefulset.apps/vault manages` pods for Vault, a tool for secrets management.
3. Services (svc): Services are an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them.

   - Services like service/alertmanager-operated and service/prometheus-operated expose certain ports for communication but have no external IP.
   - LoadBalancer services like service/app-elixir and service/app-python are meant to expose the service externally, but the external IP is pending.
   - ClusterIP services like service/kubernetes expose services within the cluster.

4. PersistentVolumeClaims (pvc): PersistentVolumeClaims are a request for storage by a user. There are none listed in your output, suggesting that you don't have any PVCs or none are in the selected namespaces.

5. ConfigMaps (cm): ConfigMaps hold configuration data for pods to consume.
   The ConfigMaps listed, such as configmap/prometheus-kube-prometheus-alertmanager-overview, contain configuration which can be used by applications or system components.
