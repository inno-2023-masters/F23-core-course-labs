## Accessed apps content

#### First pod
`>  kubectl exec python-app-0 -- cat data/visits.json`
`{"counter": 66}`

#### Second pod
`>  kubectl exec python-app-1 -- cat data/visits.json`
`{"counter": 72}`

#### Third pod
`>  kubectl exec python-app-2 -- cat data/visits.json`
`{"counter": 76}`

The commands provide different results as each running pod instance is separate, 
meaning we are accessing different running websites each time.
Moreover, since we are using `PersistentVolumeClaim`, the data will keep its state even if the pod is restarted.

## Ordering and parallelism
Each pod is running independently, so that there is no connection between them. That's why there is no need for ordering guaranties.

In this case, we can support parallel launching of our pods. To do so, we can utilize `podManagementPolicy` variable with value of `Parallel` 
in our `statefulset.yml`, to ensure the pods are launched in parallel.

## Update strategies
Pods Update Strategies determine how the old version of a pod should be replaced with a new version with minimal downtime.

There are mainly two types of update strategies available: RollingUpdate and Recreate.

1. `RollingUpdate`:

    Kubernetes performs RollingUpdate as the default update strategy for applications. 
    It ensures smooth transitions between the old and new versions of pods by `updating one pod at a time`. 
    The process continues incrementally until all old replicas are replaced with the new versions.

    The advantages of using RollingUpdate include:
      - Zero downtime deployments: Since only one pod at a time updates, the application can continue to process without any downtime.
      - Granting control over the rate of deployment: You can choose the pace at which the update rolls out by configuring the strategy specific fields.

2. `Recreate`:

    With the Recreate strategy, Kubernetes terminates all the old replicas before creating new ones. 
    The Recreate strategy is used when application cannot roll out a new version side by side with the old version. 
    
    The advantage of such strategy is the fast-pace of updating, having all the old pods update at one time.
    The disadvantage of this strategy is that it might cause service downtime during the update.
