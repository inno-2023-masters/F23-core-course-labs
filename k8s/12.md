## Task 1: Upgrade Application for Persistence

### Description

In this task, the application is enhanced to persist data by implementing a counter logic that keeps track of the number of times it's accessed. The counter number is saved in a `visits` file. Additionally, a new endpoint `/visits` is introduced to display the recorded visits.

### Steps Completed

1. **Upgrade Your Application:**

   - The application logic is modified to include:
     - Implementation of a counter logic to track the number of accesses.
     - Saving the counter number in the `visits` file.
     - Introduction of a new endpoint `/visits` to display the recorded visits.
   - Testing the changes involves updating the `docker-compose.yml` to include a new volume with the `visits` file. Verification is done to ensure that the enhancements work as expected, with the updated number visible in the `visits` file on the host machine.
   - The `README.md` for the application is updated to reflect the changes made.

### Code Overview

The application is a Flask web server written in Python. It includes two endpoints:

- **`/` (Root Endpoint):** Displays the current time and increments the visit counter.
- **`/visits`:** Displays the total number of visits recorded.

The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image for the application, and a Docker Compose file is provided for easy deployment.

### Docker Setup

The Docker setup includes:

- Base image: `python:3-alpine3.15`
- Working directory set to `/app`
- Application files copied to the container
- User `myuser` is created, and ownership and permissions are set
- Required packages are installed from `requirements.txt`
- Exposes port `8080` for the Flask app
- The Flask app is started with the CMD instruction

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `app_python` based on the Docker image `m4k4rich/updated-python-app:latest`. The service is configured to run as the `myuser` user, expose port `8080`, and use a volume (`python_app_visits`) to persist the `visits.txt` file.

### Deployment Script

The deployment script (`deploy.sh`) handles the following tasks:

- Stops and removes containers based on the specified image
- Deletes the local image version
- Builds and pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub using buildx for the specified platform
- Builds and runs the application using Docker Compose, ensuring that images are rebuilt with the `--build` flag

### Docker Volumes

A named volume (`python_app_visits`) is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file to persist the `visits.txt` file, ensuring that visit data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed.
