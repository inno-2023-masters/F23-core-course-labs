## Justification for Using Vue

I've used JavaScript for the backend, as it is native to the browser, and with Vue framework the solution is very easy to read. While setup was harder than useing default ts, there are benifits of Vue:

- It has native support for Eslint and setups it automatically.
- Allows to use DRY principle in html - you can have templates and reuse them
- Subjective, but it is funnier to use than default js/html combo

## Implementation of Best Practices and Coding Standards

- **Gitignore**: The same: I've added a gitignore file to ignore the virtual environment and the cache. Used default Vue gitignore for it.
- **Readme**: I've added a readme file to explain how to run the application and what it does.
- **Structure**: Structure uses default Vue template with separation of logic and code.
- **Linter**: Checked the quality of code by `eslint`

## Use of linters

I've used `eslint` to check my JavaScript code for errors and style issues.
