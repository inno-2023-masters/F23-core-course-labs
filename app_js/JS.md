# JS

## Framework Justification

Node.js is a standard for js web serer development with practically zero competitors.
Express is a framework built upon node js.
It is the most popular solution for quick server development.
It adds several useful features to node.JS,
like Middleware, Routing, Templating and DB integration.
Other solutions are less popular, so I chose Express.
TypeScript makes maintaining code easier.
It is a superset of JavaScript, so it is easy to learn.

## Applied Best Practices

- **Linter**: ESLint is used for code style checking
- **Project structure**: Application of approved project structures
- **Gitignore**: Keeping repository clean
- **Autotests**: Async tests using Jest
