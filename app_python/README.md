## CI Workflow

Jobs:

1. **Build**

    - Python Setup - setup python 3.11

    - Cache dependencies - use cache to store dependencies

    - Dependencies install

    - Vulnerability check - using Snyk to check for vulnerabilities

    - Vulnerability report - generate report of vulnerabilities

    - Linter

    - Tests

2. **Docker**

    - Login - login to docker hub

    - Build and Push - build docker image and push it to docker hub

I used Snyk in build stage in case to reduce dependencies installations.
