# Best practices for CI workflows that I implemented

## 1. Separate jobs

I've separated the CI process into distinct jobs: linting, testing, Docker-related tasks, and vulnerability checks. This separation:
- allows for clearer visibility into which specific process might fail,
- enables parallel execution, speeding up the workflow,
- makes logs and outputs more organized and easier to debug.

## 2. Specify exact versions

Using exact versions for actions or tools ensures that my CI process remains consistent. This avoids unexpected changes or behaviors that can arise from updated tools or actions.

## 3. Caching

Caching is crucial for speeding up repetitive tasks. By caching dependencies, I avoid redundant downloads and installations, reducing the overall time of the CI process. I've implemented caching for our Python dependencies using the `actions/cache` action.

## 4. Dependency management

Before running tests or linting, I ensure that all required dependencies are installed. This guarantees that my CI environment mirrors my local development environment, leading to consistent results.

## 5. Docker integration

My CI process includes steps to build a Docker image of our application and push it to DockerHub. This ensures that my application is always available as a containerized solution, ready for deployment.

## 6. Vulnerability checks

Security is paramount. I've integrated Snyk into our CI workflow to check for vulnerabilities in my dependencies. This ensures that my application remains secure and that I're alerted to any potential security issues in our dependencies.

## 7. Workflow status badge

Adding a workflow status badge to the README provides visibility into the CI process's status. It's a quick way to determine if the latest commit or pull request passed all CI checks.
