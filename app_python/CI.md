# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices and features of the Continuous Integration (CI) workflow for this project. It provides an overview of the implemented practices and their significance in optimizing the workflow's efficiency and reliability.

## Best Practices

### Caching Dependencies
To enhance workflow efficiency, caching has been implemented for Python dependencies. Caching is utilized to store and reuse dependencies between workflow runs, reducing the need to reinstall them.

### Conditional Steps
The workflow incorporates conditional steps, allowing certain parts of the workflow to be skipped when changes to Docker files are not detected. This helps optimize resource utilization.

### Workflow Status Badge
A workflow status badge has been added to the project's README. This badge provides real-time visibility into the current status of the CI workflow.

## Features and Considerations

### Parallel Jobs
While the workflow does not explicitly define parallel jobs, it consists of two separate jobs: "build" and "docker_build_push." These jobs serve different purposes, and parallelization may not be necessary in this context.

### Timeouts
Timeout values may be considered to prevent long-running jobs from consuming excessive resources.
