# Continuous Integration (CI) Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices implemented in CI workflow to ensure code quality, security, and reliability.

## Workflow Overview

CI workflow is designed to perform the following tasks for every code push:

1. **Checkout**: The workflow starts by checking out the latest code from the repository.

2. **Python Environment Setup**: I set up the Python environment using the specified Python version (3.11 in this case).

3. **Install Dependencies**: I install project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.

4. **Linting**: I use `pylint` to statically analyze Python code for style and maintainability issues. A high score is maintained to ensure code quality.

5. **Unit Testing**: I run unit tests using `unittest`. These tests verify the correctness of my code.

6. **Snyk Vulnerability Check**: I use Snyk to check for vulnerabilities in Python dependencies, ensuring that I don't introduce security risks.

7. **Docker Build and Push**: I build a Docker image of our application and push it to Docker Hub. This containerization process ensures deployment consistency.

## Best Practices

### Code Linting

- Code is linted using `pylint` to maintain a consistent code style and catch potential issues.
- The codebase consistently maintains a high linting score (10/10) to ensure code quality.

### Unit Testing

- Implemented unit tests using `unittest` to verify the correctness of code.
- Tests are located in the `app_python/tests` directory and follow the naming pattern `*_tests.py`.

### Dependency Management

- Using `requirements.txt` file to list project dependencies, I made it easy to manage and reproduce our Python environment.

### Security Scanning

- Scaning for security vulnerabilities in our Python dependencies using Snyk.
- Snyk tokens are stored securely as secrets in our repository.

### Docker Containerization

- Application is containerized using Docker, ensuring that it can be deployed consistently across different environments.
- Docker images are pushed to Docker Hub for easy access and deployment.
