# Best Practices in Python CI Workflow

* Version Control Integration: The workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the main branch for automatic code validation before merging.
* Job Isolation: Each job runs on an isolated runner to ensure consistent, conflict-free builds.
* Dependency Management: Dependencies are managed via requirements.txt, ensuring reproducible builds.
* Code Linting: The workflow includes a flake8 step to maintain code style and quality.
* Unit Testing: pytest is used for automated unit tests, ensuring code correctness and preventing regressions.
* Docker Image Management: Securely manages Docker images by logging into Docker Hub using GitHub secrets, building images, and pushing them to a repository.
