# Why Django

I chose Flask because it is simple and minimalistic, so for me, this is a good option to start to understand the implementation of the backend in python.

# Best practices and coding standards

- PEP8 
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Usage of constants
- Names reflects the meaning of variables, functions
- Usage of different files for different needs.

[//]: # (# Testing)

[//]: # (I tested the application by running the ```run.py``` file and checking that the time displayed corresponds the Moscow time.)

# Unit Tests

Tests:
- test_format (checks that the format of the datetime on the web page corresponds datetime format)
- test_status (checks that status of response from the server is 200)

Best practices:
- Test One Thing at a Time
- Name Tests Meaningfully
- Keep Unit Tests Short and Focused
- Use Assertions to Validate Results
- DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
