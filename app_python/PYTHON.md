### Framework
I have chosen [falcon](https://falconframework.org/) framework for this application, since it's lightweight and a perfect fit for such a simple task.

### Testing
No autotests for now, application was tested manually.

### Code quality & coding standards
Since the application is only 10 lines of code, it's difficult to say something meaningful about implemented code quality techniques. I guess I could say the code was reviewed by my peers :)
