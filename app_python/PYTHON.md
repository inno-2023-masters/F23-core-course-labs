# App python

## Framework

I chose FastAPI for this application for several reasons:

- **Lightweight** of the framework: FastAPI is much simpler than Django
and has more features than Flask.
- **Async Support**: FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, 
that allows you to handle concurrent operations.
- **Scalability**: This framework provides a solid foundation for future scalability.
- **Automatic Documentation**: FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI documentation (Swagger).

## Best practices

1. **Project structure**

    FastAPI has its own suggestions for project structure. I've applied [this](https://github.com/zhanymkanov/fastapi-best-practices)
best practises for project structure.

1. **Tests**

    Asynchronous tests using pytest to check time updates every time you refresh the page.

    The application includes tests that checks that time updates every time when user refresh the page.

1. **Environment management**
   
    Use environment to control timezone of time to show.

1. **Async endpoints**

   Utilize asynchronous programming with `async` to improve application responsiveness.

1. **Dependency injection**

   As part of project structure, dependencies are separated by files in `requirements` folder.
