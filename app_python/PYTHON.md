# Why Django

I chose Flask because it is simple and minimalistic, so for me, this is a good option to start to understand the implementation of the backend in python.

# Best practices and coding standards

- PEP8 
- DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Usage of constants
- Names reflects the meaning of variables, functions
- Usage of different files for different needs.

# Testing

I tested the application by running the ```run.py``` file and checking that the time displayed corresponds the Moscow time.
