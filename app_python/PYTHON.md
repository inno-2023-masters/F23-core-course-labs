# Lab 1

## Framework

1. I chose among 3 frameworks:
   - Django
   - Flask
   - Hug

2. Our goal was to create **simple web application**. Therefore, I decided not to take the **Django** framework as it needs deep knowledge and is not good for small projects.

3. Secondly, I began to study the differences between **Hug** and **Flask**. Both these frameworks are lightweight and good for the small projects.

4. Finally, I decided to use **Flask**. The main reasons are:
   - Flask has extensive documentation
   - Integrated support for unit testing
   - I was familiar with the Flask

## Best practices

1. Using templates for html rendering

2. Following the `PEP 8` style guide

3. Comments that explains some complex part

4. Styles for templates are located in "_static_" folder

## Coding standards

1. Read the `PEP 8`

2. Used PyCharm hints / suggestions

3. Used `pycodestyle` library to check code style

## Testing

1. I wrote an unit test that checks response status code and correctness of time

2. I conducted manual testing in browser to check that page updates correctly and looks properly

## Unit test

I have only one unit test. Test checks that the response is 200 and that time is changed after 3 seconds.

Best practices:

1. Descriptive method and class names.

2. Test isolation.

3. Test data separation.

## Code quality

1. Used a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for the project

2. Implemented unit tests
