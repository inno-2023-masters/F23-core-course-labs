I've designed my application to feature a solitary API endpoint dedicated to displaying the current time. To validate the accuracy of this functionality, I've established a unit test specifically crafted to confirm that the endpoint consistently delivers the correct time.
Furthermore, I've implemented a basic integration test to verify not only the operational status of the application but also its ability to return the accurate time. This comprehensive testing approach ensures the robustness and reliability of the time-displaying API endpoint in my application.

Best practices:
Isolation of Unit Tests:

Unit tests are kept independent of each other. This ensures that the outcome of one test does not impact another, fostering a more robust and predictable testing environment.
Isolation from External Dependencies:

Unit tests are designed to be isolated from external dependencies. This helps in creating a controlled environment for testing, preventing issues that may arise from external factors such as network fluctuations or external service outages.
AAA Pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert):

Following the AAA pattern in unit tests enhances test readability and maintainability. This pattern emphasizes the importance of clearly separating the setup (Arrange), the action or operation being tested (Act), and the expected outcome or assertion (Assert).
Inclusion of Component and System (Integration) Tests:

Beyond unit tests, you have incorporated component and system (integration) tests. These higher-level tests focus on checking the overall behavior of the application, such as ensuring the app server is running correctly and returning the expected results.
