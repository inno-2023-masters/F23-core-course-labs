## Framework
I used the fastapi framework because it's fast, lightweight and easy to code.

## Coding standards, code quality
In the function names i used `snake_case`

Checked code with linter flake8

## Testing
For testing i created `test_main.py` and used `pytest` library.

Unit test checks response from app compares it with actual time
