### Framework

I have developed the application using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) production ready framework.

Pros:

1. High performance
2. Easy to use
3. Scalability

Cons:

1. Limited ecosystem
2. Compatibility with older versions of Python
3. Maturity of the framework

### Best practices

Used _black_ code formatter,  _isort_ utility to sort imports alphabetically and _flake8_ linter.

Followed PEP 8 style guide, added make file, gitignore and documented my code.

### Unit Tests
I have written unit test for root handler.
Since this service is simple, it is okay to check 200 status code and time format.
