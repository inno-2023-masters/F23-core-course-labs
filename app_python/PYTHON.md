# Best practices

## Project Structure:

Organize your project with a well-defined structure. A common structure includes folders for templates, static files, and Python code. Here's a simplified example:

```
myapp/
├── app/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── templates/
│   ├── static/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── routes.py
├── config.py
├── run.py
```

## Dependency Management:

Use a requirements.txt file to list all your project dependencies. You can create it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` while your virtual environment is active, or by running `pip show {package_name}` if you are outside of the virtual environment.

## Documentation:

Document your code, API endpoints, and any external dependencies thoroughly. Tools like Swagger can help with API documentation.

## Configuration:

Store configuration variables separately, usually in a `config.py` file. You can include items like database connection strings, secret keys, etc. Make use of Python's `configparser` or environment variables to manage configuration.

## Static Files:

Place static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images in a designated `static` directory. Utilize FastAPI's `static_files` feature to serve these files and use the appropriate URL paths in your templates.

## Testing:

Write unit tests for your application using a testing framework like `pytest``. This ensures that your application behaves as expected and helps prevent regressions.

## Logging:

Implement proper logging to capture errors and important events in your application. Python's built-in `logging` module is a good choice.

## Database:

If your application needs a database, choose one that fits your needs (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL). Use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.

# Production ready frameworks

There are several production-ready Python web frameworks available, each with its own strengths and use cases. Here's a list of some popular ones:

## Django:

Django is a high-level framework that provides a lot of built-in functionality for web development, including an ORM, authentication, and admin panels. It's great for large and complex projects but might be overkill for small projects due to its extensive feature set.

## Flask:

Flask is a micro-framework that's lightweight and flexible. It's well-suited for small to medium-sized projects because it allows developers to choose the libraries and components they need. Flask doesn't come with as many built-in features as Django, but it's highly extensible.

## FastAPI:

FastAPI is a modern web framework specifically designed for building APIs with Python. While it's not as feature-rich as Django, it offers several advantages that make it a compelling choice for small projects:

### Fast:

FastAPI is one of the fastest Python web frameworks available due to its use of asynchronous programming and automatic data validation.

### Type Annotations and Interactive Documentation:

FastAPI leverages Python type annotations to automatically validate request and response data, making it easier to write reliable code and allows FastAPI to automatically generates interactive API documentation using tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc.

### Async Support:

FastAPI fully supports asynchronous programming, which can be beneficial when dealing with I/O-bound operations in small projects.

# In this project

I decided to use FastAPI as the framework for building a web-based application. I applied several best practices to ensure that the project would be production-ready and maintainable.

## Here are the key best practices I implemented:

### Project Structure:

I structured the project following the guidelines recommended by FastAPI documentation, which involved segregating the code, templates, and static files. This organized approach greatly facilitated the management and maintenance of the application.

### Dependency Management:

I maintained a `requirements.txt` file to list all project dependencies, making it easy to recreate the environment on other machines.

### Static Files:

I stored static files like CSS and JavaScript in the `static` folder and used FastAPI's StaticFiles class to serve them.

## Why I chose FastAPI:

I chose FastAPI for several reasons:

### Performance:

FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities and automatic data validation make it highly efficient, ensuring fast response times and optimal performance.

### Type Annotations:

FastAPI's use of Python type hints for data validation simplifies code development and reduces the risk of runtime errors.

### Interactive Documentation:

FastAPI's ability to generate interactive API documentation with tools like Swagger UI and ReDoc saved time in documenting the API.

### Ease of Learning:

FastAPI's clear and intuitive API design made it accessible to me as a developer, which was important for a university project with a tight deadline.

## Pros of FastAPI:

- Fast and efficient.
- Strong typing and data validation.
- Automatic API documentation.
- Asynchronous support.
- Easy to learn and use.

## Cons of FastAPI:

- Limited built-in features compared to full-stack frameworks like Django.
- Smaller community and ecosystem compared to more established frameworks.

# Linters:

There are several Python linters available, each with its own features and strengths. The choice of the best linter depends on your specific project requirements and coding style preferences. Here's a list of some popular Python linters:

## Pylint:

Pylint is one of the most well-known Python linters. It checks your code against a wide range of coding standards and offers extensive customization options.

## flake8:

Flake8 combines several tools (PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and McCabe) into one, providing a simpler and more unified code checking experience.

## pyflakes:

Pyflakes is a lightweight linter that checks for simple errors and reports them without offering style recommendations.

I decided to use pylint

# Testing best practices

## Document Tests:

Write clear and descriptive test case names and use docstrings to document what each test is checking. This makes it easier for other developers to understand your tests.

## Keep Tests Isolated:

Ensure that tests are isolated from each other and do not rely on the order of execution. Use separate test databases and reset them before each test case if necessary.

## Mock External Dependencies:

When your API interacts with external services, databases, or APIs, use mocking libraries like unittest.mock or pytest-mock to simulate the behavior of these dependencies. This allows you to test your API in isolation.

## Use Pydantic Models:

FastAPI relies heavily on Pydantic models for request and response validation. Use Pydantic models in your test cases to validate input and output data. This ensures that your API behaves correctly and that you're testing against valid data.

## Test Each Endpoint Separately:

Write individual test cases for each endpoint of your API. This helps isolate issues and makes it easier to pinpoint problems when tests fail.

## Use Pytest:

Pytest is a popular testing framework in the Python ecosystem. It's easy to use and offers a range of features for testing, including parameterized tests, fixtures, and plugins. You can use Pytest for writing and running your FastAPI tests.
