# Python Web Application 

> This is a python app that displays a current time in Moscow, it implements best practices and follows coding standarts. It was tested and the time updates upon page refreshing.

## Framework choice

> For this task I choose to use Flask as a framework. 

**Flask is a good framework for this task because:**

1. `Simplicity` : 
    - It is minimalistic and doesn't come with unnecessary features. For a small application like this, simplicity is an advantage. 

2. `Flexibility` : 
    - There is no rigid structure, that allows me to organize the project as I see fit, More precisely I was able to use `html`, and did not have the need to learn any custom markup language instead.

## Best practices 

1. `PEP 8`:
    - I followed PEP 8 guidelines.

2. `Zen of Python`:
    - In order to uphold best practices I followed 'Zen of Python'


## Coding standards 

> PEP 8 coding standads were used. Below the description of some coding standards that I used.

1. `Tabs or spaces`: 
    - I used spaces as it it a preferred indentation method. 

2. `Maximum Line Length`: 
    - My maximum line length did not exceed 79 characters.

3. `Imports`:
    - Import are on separate lines.

4. `Whitespace in expressions and statements`: 
    - All extraneous whitespace are avoided.
