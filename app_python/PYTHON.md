### Framework
I have chosen [falcon](https://falconframework.org/) framework for this application, since it's lightweight and a perfect fit for such a simple task.

### Testing
Tests are written using "unittest" module. Since the app is so small and does not have any logic to be tested, currently there is only one e2e test

### Code quality & coding standards
Since the application is only 10 lines of code, it's difficult to say something meaningful about implemented code quality techniques. I guess I could say the code was reviewed by my peers :)
