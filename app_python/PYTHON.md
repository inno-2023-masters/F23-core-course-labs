[ðŸ‘‰ A link to the original article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/why-fastapi-is-a-future-of-python-web-development-181bed9d46f4)
* **Speed.** FastAPI is built with high-performance libraries such as Pydantic and Uvicorn.
* **Simplicity.** FastAPI comes with an intuitive API that is easy to learn and use.
* **Validation.** FastAPI uses Pythonâ€™s type hints to automatically validate API requests and responses, as well as to automatically serialize and deserialize data to and from JSON.
* **Documentation.** FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation.
* **ASGI support.** FastAPI is built on top of Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, allowing it to leverage the power of asynchronous programming.
* **Dependency injection.** FastAPI makes use of Pythonâ€™s dependency injection system to automatically inject dependencies into API endpoints and other components.

### Best Practices
* Format code with the [Black Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)
* Code style with [Flake8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.flake8)
* Use of easy and intuitive FastAPI
* Test the project using pytest
