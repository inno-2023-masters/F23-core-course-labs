## Best Practices

1. **Modularity**: The code is well-organized into distinct functions. The `show_time` function handles the logic for the '/' route, promoting code maintainability and readability.

2. **Dependency Management**: The code imports only the necessary libraries (Flask, datetime, pytz) and avoids including any unused imports.

3. **Route Definition**: Flask's `@app.route('/')` decorator is effectively used to define the route for the root URL ('/'). This follows Flask's recommended route definition pattern.

## Framework Choice

### Flask

Flask is a lightweight, beginner-friendly, and flexible web framework. It's an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications, especially for those who are new to web development due to its simplicity. Flask allows developers the freedom to choose their components and libraries, making it easy to start. However, for larger and more complex projects, Flask might require more effort to scale and may lack certain built-in features that larger frameworks offer.

## Linters

Linters play a crucial role in maintaining code quality and consistency. In this project, we used the following linters:

- Python: Flake8
- Markdown: markdownlint

## Unit Tests and Testing Best Practices

Here, I describe the unit test created for the application and the best practices applied:

1. **Test Coverage**: I've implemented comprehensive unit tests that cover various aspects of the application's functionality. These tests include scenarios for different time zones, ensuring that the `show_time` function behaves as expected.

2. **Test Organization**: To maintain a clean and organized codebase, I've structured the unit tests in a separate directory, typically named `tests`. Each test file is named to correspond to the module or functionality it tests, following the naming convention `test_[module_name].py`.

3. **Assertions**: Each unit test contains clear and descriptive assertions that verify the expected behavior of the code. These assertions help pinpoint the exact source of issues when tests fail, facilitating debugging and maintenance.

4. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: I've integrated unit testing into the CI workflow using GitHub Actions. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the CI workflow automatically runs the unit tests, ensuring that new code contributions do not introduce regressions.
