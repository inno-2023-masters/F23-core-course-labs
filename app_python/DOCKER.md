# Best practices

## Create a Non-Root User:

Run your application as a non-root user for security reasons. Use the `USER` directive to switch a non-root user, and ensure that your application files are accessible to that user.

## Copy Requirements First:

Copy your `requirements.txt` file into the container and install dependencies before copying the rest of your application code. This way, you can take advantage of Docker's caching for faster builds.

## Optimize Docker Build Context:

Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker build context. This speeds up the build process and reduces the size of the build context.

## Limit Exposed Ports:

Only expose the ports that your application actually needs. Don't expose unnecessary ports, as this reduces the attack surface of your container.

## Clean Up:

Remove unnecessary files and dependencies after installing packages to reduce the image size. Use `apt-get clean`, `pip uninstall`, or similar commands to clean up.

## Use Multi-Stage Builds:

Use multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size. In the first stage, build your application with development tools. In the second stage, copy only the necessary files from the first stage to a smaller image.

## Optimize Docker Build Context:

Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from the Docker build context. This speeds up the build process and reduces the size of the build context.

## Documentation:

Include comments and documentation in your Dockerfile to explain its purpose and any custom configurations or build steps.
