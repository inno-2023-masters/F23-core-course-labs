# Dockerfile Best Practices

## Trusted Base Image

A trusted base image serves as the foundation for the Docker container. The use of official images ensures that a solid and well-maintained foundation is built upon, reducing the risk associated with unreliable base images.

## User Privileges

The best practice of avoiding unnecessary privileges is employed within the Dockerfile for this project. A dedicated user is created within the Docker container to run the application, thereby enhancing security and reducing potential risks.

## Exposed Ports

In the Dockerfile, necessary ports are explicitly exposed. This practice makes it evident which ports the application requires for communication.

## Layer Sanity

To optimize the build process and improve Docker image layer management, a priority is given to installing the required libraries at the outset of the Dockerfile. This practice minimizes changes in layers that are less likely to change frequently, resulting in faster and more efficient image builds.

## Linting

Linting is applied to the Dockerfile to enforce code quality and adherence to best practices. A Dockerfile linter is used to analyze the file for potential issues, ensuring that it conforms to Dockerfile best practices and standards. This step enhances the overall quality and reliability of the Docker image.
