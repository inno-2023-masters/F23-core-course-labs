# Applied Terraform Best Practices

The following Terraform best practices have been applied in the project to ensure efficient infrastructure management:

1. **Workspace Segregation**: Workspaces have been organized to segregate different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) and projects, enhancing isolation and access control.

2. **Input Variables**: Input variables are leveraged in modules to make them flexible and customizable for different use cases.

3. **Output Variables**: Output variables are defined in modules to provide valuable information for other parts of the infrastructure.

4. **Secure Secrets Storage**: Sensitive information is never hardcoded in Terraform code; instead, a secure secrets management tool and environment variables are used.

5. **Limited Secrets Exposure**: Access and permissions to secrets are strictly controlled to minimize exposure.
