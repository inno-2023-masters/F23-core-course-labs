- ```
  $terraform state list
  yandex_compute_instance.vm-1
  yandex_compute_instance.vm-2
  yandex_vpc_network.network-1
  yandex_vpc_subnet.subnet-1
  ```
- [`terraform plan`](https://pastebin.com/hfTCamhL) (click) after the following changes:
  - change OS of the second VM from Ubuntu to Debian
- ```
  $terraform output
  external_ip_address_vm_1 = "51.250.29.173"
  external_ip_address_vm_2 = "51.250.18.166"
  internal_ip_address_vm_1 = "192.168.10.29"
  internal_ip_address_vm_2 = "192.168.10.23"

## Best practices
1. Variables and outputs are declared is separate files (`variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` respectively
2. `.tfstate` files are uploaded to VCS so that anyone authorized can manage the infrastructure from the right state
3. Secrets are injected through env or input variables
4. `terraform fmt` is applied to each configuration
