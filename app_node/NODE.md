# Node.js Web Application
![Node-CI workflow](https://github.com/artkochergin/core-course-labs/actions/workflows/node-ci.yml/badge.svg)

> This is a Node.js application that showcases the current time in Moscow, adhering to best practices and coding standards. It has been thoroughly tested, ensuring that the time updates seamlessly upon page refresh.

## Framework Selection

**Node.js is an excellent choice for this task for the following reasons:**

1. Efficiency and Speed:
    - Node.js is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture. This makes it highly efficient and responsive, ideal for delivering real-time updates like the current time.

2. Ecosystem:
   -  Node.js boasts a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries, enabling me to easily implement the required functionality without reinventing the wheel.

## Adherence to Best Practices
Code Consistency:
 - I ensured that the codebase maintained a consistent style, adhering to the established best practices within the Node.js community.

## Coding Standards

> While Node.js doesn't enforce strict coding standards, there are some common conventions and best practices followed by developers when writing Node.js code.

1. Use const and let: 
   - In this script, const is used for variables that should not be reassigned (http, server, port), and let is used for variables (randomNumber) that may change their value.

2. Arrow Functions: 
   - The script uses arrow functions for defining the callback functions, such as (req, res) => {...} and () => {...}. Arrow functions are commonly used in Node.js for concise and clean syntax.
