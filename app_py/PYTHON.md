# Why I choosed Flask.

Flask is better for smaller, less-complicated projects that have well-defined scopes and shorter anticipated lifetimes. Compared to other frameworks in web-application field, Flask provides easiest start among all, and considering, that time-showing app have only education purpose and need to be done only within the framework of Lab 1, Flask is the best choice.

# Main advantages of the Flask.

* Framework is easy to learn and easy to support
* It is used by many open-source and commercial projects
* It will be supported for many years

# Linter
As linter for python I used Pylint, it's usage is simple and effective, since it prints all the necessary information user should fix about their code

# Usage
Run using:  flask run

# Unit Tests
Added simple unit tests to check if app is running.
## Best practices:
* Run Your Test Suite Regularly - to check if app is ok
* Simple code structue - not too complex, not too
* Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases (DAMP)
